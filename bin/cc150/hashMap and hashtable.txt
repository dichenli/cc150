In java, Hashtable is synchronized and thread safe. HashMap is not. 
Hashtable don't allow null, HashMap allow one null in key and many nulls in values;

For anyone, if you need two different object to hash to the same key, you need to implement both equals and hashCode methods
so that these two objects are equal and has the same hash code.

frequently used method: put(key, value), get(key), containsKey(key), isEmpty(), remove(key), clone(), values(), keySet()
