For object oriented design:
1. talk with interviewer to remove ambiguity. Don't make assumptions
2. define core objects
3. explicify relationships among objects
4. make clear what are the behaviors of each object, determine methods and fields needed

write down notes while making these specifications.
while implementing OO design, there are always different ways to do them. Talk with interviewer, always focus on long term
flexibility and maintainability

Writing out scaffold and stubs/fake code is far more important than going to every details, if the problem is huge, so don't
go into fight with details if the scaffold is not yet clear. You will waste time finding those sophisticated code you wrote 
is useless.
