to copy an array, some options:
1. Integer[] list = new Integer[10];
newList = (Integer[]) list.clone();
this is a shallow copy method, only elements references are copied
the clone() method is inherited from Object. It's a flawed method for most classes, but works fine for array
because the method returns Object type, so casting is necessary
2. Arrays.copyOf(int[] array, int newLength);
returns a copy of array
3. for ArrayList, we can call ArrayList<E> newList.addAll(Iterable<? extends E> oldList);
